# Explore Weather Trends Project

## Summary
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends locally to overall global temperature trends.

## Instructions
My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in a city.

- Extract the data from the database. 
    - Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
    - Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
- Open up the CSV in whatever tool most comfortable using. (e.g. Excel, Google, Python, R)
- Create a line chart that compares the local city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. 
- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and the local city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Examples:
    - Is the city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
    - “How do the changes in the city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
    - What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?

## Submission Objectives

- An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
    - What tools were used for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
    - How was moving average calculated?
    - What were the key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
- Line chart with local and global temperature trends
- At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends
